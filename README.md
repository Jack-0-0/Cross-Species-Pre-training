# Cross Species Pre-training
This project evaluates the performance of hyena call detection and classification when a neural network is first pre-trained on human laughter. There are three subsections, preprocessing, train and evaluation. Each section uses outputs from the previous section.

* preprocessing – how to convert the audio datasets into the datasets used to train and test the network.
* train – how to create baseline networks and how to fine tune the laughter network on hyena calls.
* evaluation – how to evaluate the performance of the network.
