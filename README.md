# Cross Species Pre-training
This project evaluates the performance of hyena call detection and classification when a neural network is first pre-trained on human laughter. There are three subsections, preprocessing, train and evaluation. Each section uses outputs from the previous section.

* preprocessing – convert the audio datasets into the datasets used to train and test the networks.
* train – create baseline networks and fine tune the laughter networks on hyena calls.
* evaluation – evaluate the performance of the networks.
